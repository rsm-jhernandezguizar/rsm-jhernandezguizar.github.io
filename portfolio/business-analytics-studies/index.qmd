## Overview

A collection of case studies from advanced business analytics coursework, demonstrating proficiency in statistical modeling, experimental design, and quantitative analysis across diverse business contexts.

These projects showcase various analytical techniques applied to real-world business problems, from fundraising optimization to consumer preference modeling.

## Case Studies

### [📊 Fundraising Campaign Effectiveness](/archived-portfolio-items/fundraising-campaign-analysis/)
**Replication study of matching grant strategies (Karlan & List, 2007)**

Analysis of a large-scale field experiment testing the effectiveness of different fundraising letter treatments. Explores how matching grants influence donor behavior and contribution amounts.

**Techniques**: A/B testing, hypothesis testing, experimental design, causal inference

---

### [📈 Patent Success & Airbnb Demand Analysis](/archived-portfolio-items/patent-airbnb-analysis/)
**Poisson and negative binomial regression case studies**

Two complementary studies: analyzing factors that influence patent applications and modeling Airbnb listing demand patterns using count data regression models.

**Techniques**: Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, count data models, overdispersion analysis

---

### [🎬 Streaming Service Consumer Preferences](/archived-portfolio-items/streaming-preferences/)
**Conjoint analysis and multinomial logit modeling**

Investigation of consumer preferences for streaming service features (brand, pricing, ads) using conjoint analysis to understand utility functions and willingness to pay.

**Techniques**: Conjoint analysis, multinomial logit (MNL) models, maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian MCMC

---

### [🔍 Clustering & Classification Methods](/archived-portfolio-items/clustering-classification/)
**K-means clustering and machine learning applications**

Exploration of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, including customer segmentation and predictive classification using various machine learning algorithms.

**Techniques**: K-means clustering, classification algorithms, model evaluation, cross-validation

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Statistical Modeling**: Regression analysis, generalized linear models, Bayesian methods
- **Experimental Design**: A/B testing, causal inference, randomized controlled trials
- **Machine Learning**: Clustering, classification, model selection and validation
- **Programming**: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib)
- **Business Application**: Translating analytical findings into actionable insights
